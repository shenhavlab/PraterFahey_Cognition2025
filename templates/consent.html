                    <strong>Key Information</strong><br />
                    You are invited to take part in a Brown University research study.<br /><br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>PURPOSE: The study aims to improve our understanding of how we make choices and perform cognitive tasks. Participation in this study is completely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any point. In order to participate, you must be between 18 and 90 years old.</li>
                        <li>PROCEDURES: You will be asked to complete several computerized tasks that will involve viewing stimuli on the screen (e.g., shapes, words, images, complex patterns) and indicating a response based on the task instructions indicated. Responses may involve making choices, performing a mental task (e.g., holding information in memory), and/or performing a physical action (e.g., pressing a button). You may also be asked to make decisions, choices, or perform a task for others, and your decisions may be used in studies with future participants. In the case that your decisions are used for future studies your decisions or choices will be de-identified. Some of these tasks may offer additional incentives over and above your base pay (see Compensation). You may be asked to complete brief surveys about your preferences, personal history, and demographic information. You may be asked to complete surveys which ask questions pertaining to your mental health. Following the experiment, you will be debriefed on the specific experimental goals.</li>
                        <li>TIME INVOLVED: This is a 1 session study. The session will take approximately 5-60 minutes of your time. </li>
                        <li>COMPENSATION: You will be paid a base rate of $6.50/hour for each study completed.In addition to this compensation, you may receive additional compensation (e.g., in the form of monetary rewards, opportunity to give a charitable donation, or gift cards) based on your choices and/or performance on the available tasks. It is also possible that you may receive additional compensation based on outcomes of previous experiments (from our lab) similar to this one.</li>
                        <li>RISKS: Experiments involve operating a desktop computer or handling small objects (e.g. a  keypad). The tasksinvolved in these experiments can require some mental effort, and you may therefore experience some fatigue duringthe experiment. However, for those studies, you will receive ample time for rest periods and/or stretch breaks. It isalso possible that some questions on the surveys particularly those regarding your mental health may make youuncomfortable. However, if that is the case, you are free to skip these types of questions.</li>
                        <li>BENEFITS: You will not receive any direct benefit from your participating though you may draw satisfaction fromthe knowledge that information generated by this study may help promote better understanding of the mechanismsinvolved in how we make decisions.</li>
                        <li>CONFIDENTIALITY: The research team will make every effort to keep all the information you tell us during the study strictly confidential. Any documents you sign, where you can be identified by name will be kept in Qualtrics which complies with Brown’s data storage security requirements for identifiable data. These documents will be kept confidential. Data from this study may be shared with other investigators for research purposes. Under those conditions, we will only share de-identified data – data absent the names of the participants and other potentially identifying information.<br/><br/>Your unique mTurk participant ID will be recorded with your data as a way for us to confirm you have completed the experiment and then properly compensate and bonus you. Our only purpose for recording this ID will be to distribute compensation. Your ID will not be shared with anyone outside of our research team.<br/><br/>While your mTurk ID does not directly identify you, it can be linked to your public profile page. As such, you may wish to restrict what information you choose to share on this public profile. For more information about the privacy and confidentiality limitations associated with using mTurk please refer to Amazon’s mTurk Privacy Policy: https://www.mturk.com/mturk/privacynotice. Additionally, Amazon has a warning to workers regarding contacting requesters (https://www.mturk.com/mturk/contact). This warning states, "Your email address will automatically be inserted into the message so the Requester can reply to you." Amazon will also insert your name into the email. If youchoose to contact us, your name and email will only ever be used to respond to your communications. That information will not be saved or distributed to anyone outside of our research team.</li>
                        <li>VOLUNTARY: Your participation in this study is completely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time without penalty. If you withdraw, you will receive full payment. You are also free to omit an answer for any of the questionnaires or to stop any of the tasks at any point.<br/><br/>You may withdraw by closing the browser window in which you are completing the study and contacting the researcher via the “Contact this requester” button on the HIT Details page to indicate that you have withdrawn, and noquestions will be asked.</li>
                        <li>CONTACT INFORMATION: If you have any questions or concerns about this study or the research being conducted,you may contact the Principal Investigator, Amitai Shenhav, Ph.D., at (401) 863-5198 or amitai_shenhav@brown.edu.</li>
                        <li>YOUR RIGHTS: If you have questions about your rights and welfare as a volunteer in the research study you maycontact the Brown University Human Research Protection Program at (401) 863-3050.

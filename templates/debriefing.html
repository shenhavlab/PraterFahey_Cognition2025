		<p>Thank you for your participation in our study!  Your anonymous data makes an
		important contribution to our understanding of cognitive control and reward processing. </p>

		<p>To achieve most high-level goals, people must utilize cognitive control, the set of processes that enables them to hold those goals in mind and perform the set of operations required for a given task. However, cognitive control is effortful, and individuals vary in their ability and/or desire to exert such cognitive effort. This experiment aims to tease apart two key factors that are critical for deciding how much effort to invest in a task: (1) the reward one expects for succeeding at the task, and (2) how likely they think they are to succeed given a particular level of cognitive effort (the perceived efficacy of that effort investment). We expect that people will exert more effort both as reward increases, and as perceived efficacy increases.</p>
		
		<p>If you have any questions about this research, you may contact the
